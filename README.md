# Swarmauri Chatbot

Welcome to the **Swarmauri Chatbot** repository! This chatbot was built using Python and Gradio, designed to interact and provide responses based on the user's input. It's a fun project built as part of a tutorial and serves as a foundation for further chatbot developments.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Swarmauri Chatbot** is a simple conversational agent that responds to text input. It showcases the use of Python and a user-friendly interface provided by Gradio, allowing users to engage in a dynamic conversation. This chatbot is designed to be easily customizable, making it a great base for anyone looking to experiment with chatbot development.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Real-time interaction**: The chatbot responds immediately to user input.
- **User-friendly interface**: Thanks to Gradio, it provides an easy-to-use interface for interaction.
- **Customizable responses**: You can modify the chatbot's logic to respond differently based on the user's input.
- **Simple Deployment**: The app can be deployed locally or shared via a public URL (Gradio share link).

## 💻 How to Use

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/swarmari-chatbot.git
cd swarmari-chatbot
```

### Install Dependencies

Before running the chatbot, install the necessary dependencies. This project relies on `Gradio`  to create the interface.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Chatbot Locally

To run the chatbot on your local machine, you can use the following command. It will launch the Gradio interface on a local URL.

```bash
python chatbot.py
```


Once the app starts, it will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:7864` (Gradio).


## 📝 Customization

Feel free to edit the chatbot's logic and customize the responses. You can modify the chatbot's behavior by changing the `chatbot_response` function in the code. Here’s an example:

```python
def chatbot_response(message):
    if "hello" in message.lower():
        return "Hi there! How can I help you today?"
    else:
        return "Sorry, I didn't understand that."
```

This allows you to build more complex responses based on user input.
